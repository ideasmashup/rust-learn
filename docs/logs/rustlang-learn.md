# Rust Learn Book Marathon activity log

> I made and followed [this template](docs/logs/template.md) to document each day of this journey. I plan to follow it on future learning marathons if successful !

## What ?

**This is it !** My second and hopefully successful attempt to learn rust (rustlang) as quickly as possible !

My whole process, and every day of learning will be described in this activity log, so others can benefit too and see if this is a hard path or not.


## Why ?

I have to write fast small programs/scripts for several tasks from work and personal projects alike. These have all become quite pressing due to pandemic lockdown, so I finally mustered the courage to go beyond the cargo Hello world tutorial, and go all the way to that web server project at the end of the "Learn Rust" book !

I dread having to go back to c++ and python or go for my needs but at least I will be sure that they are the right tools with clear first-hand insights.

## How ?

**I am a hardcore procrastinator** on hobby projects and stuff learning endeavors (10+ bought but never started courses on udemy, safari, countless books on many languages both for programming and fellow humans).

I will be pushing everything on my github and logging advances. I expect this strict regimen and rush learning with daily writing will consolidate my grasp of things.

**Environement**

Windows 10 (I am doing this from a clean [Shadow VM](https://www.shadow.tech) to have a destroyable, non-distracting environment to work from and because there is no Linux VM support 'yet' ;-) I will use Windows - *disclaimer: I work at [Shadow](https://twitter.com/ideasmashup)*)

**Constraints**

Finish the whole book in 14 days max, less = better.

## Devlog

### Day 0: better Windows 10 tools

Because Windows sucks, and I must code on it... I did a couple tweaks to make thing less awful and I did it all the day before starting my actual rush, to be ready for battle when waking up ! ;) [Read more](rust-learn/day0.md)

### Day 1: first dive gone too deep

I was so focused on understanding the sample for the guessing game I spent the day refactoring it, exploring consts, macros, inference oddities, and a lot of off-topic things. Still it was overall interesting and I think it helped me get a better grasp of trivial things that actually were trickier than expected (```match``` voodoo amongst others)!
