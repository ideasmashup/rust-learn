# The repo where I learn  awesome rust !

All training code will be pushed here and if I get motivated I'll try to write down some docs 
and blog posts to help others learn just like me !

## Activity logs

Here are all detailled logs of my effort to fully rush and complete all rust learning materials as fast as possible. Tobe effective enough to write my own programs in rust (to save myself from having to bring back my rusty c++ from its long abandoned graveyard)

> **Note to future-self / future readers:** this goal was started during the Covid19 lockdown after 2 months of "can't find time because too much work" typical procrastination ;) (30th of April 2020)

***Template:** for this project I made a [markdown activity log template file](docs/logs/template.md) that you can re-use if you want to marathon learn a programming language too !*
